## Summary of Conditions in CFI (Control Flow Integrity) Code

This code snippet contains several conditions that analyze specific instructions and determine whether register contents are considered "Safe" or "Unsafe" in the context of a dynamic execution analysis. Below is a summary of the main criteria for each block.

### 1. **"OP" and "OPi" Instructions**
   - If the instruction is an arithmetic or logic operation, it checks if the source registers (`source1` or `source2`) are safe.
   - If one of the source registers is unsafe, the destination register (`destination`) is marked as unsafe.
   - If the source registers are safe, the destination register is marked as safe.

### 2. **Load Instructions ("lw", "lh", "lb", "ld", "lbu", "lhu", "lwu")**
   - These instructions mark the destination register (`destination`) as unsafe, presumably because the loaded content might come from untrusted memory.

### 3. **"li" Instruction** (load immediate)
   - This instruction loads an immediate value into a register. Here, the destination register is marked as safe.

### 4. **"jal" Instruction** (jump and link)
   - This instruction, which jumps to a label and saves the return address, marks the destination register as safe.

### 5. **"jalr" and "jr" Instructions** (jump and link register / jump register)
   - These instructions work on `x1` (the return register). If `x1` is safe, they increment a counter (`safe_fw_cnt`).
   - If `x1` is unsafe, they increment an unsafe counter (`unsafe_fw_cnt`) and mark `x1` as safe.

### 6. **"ret" Instruction** (return)
   - This instruction, which returns to the address saved in `x1`, checks if `x1` is safe.
   - It increments `safe_bw_cnt` if `x1` is safe, or `unsafe_bw_cnt` and marks `x1` as safe if it is not.

### 7. **Unknown Instructions**
   - If the instruction does not match any recognized types, it prints an error to indicate an unrecognized instruction.
